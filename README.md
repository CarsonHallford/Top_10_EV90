# Top 10 Hitters by 90th Percentile Exit Velocity Leaderboard

This is a script that utilizes the MLB Scraper Modulue by Tnestico to scrape MLB data.

The script filters out game data for a particular team defined by the user, and calculates the 90th percentile 
exit velocity (EV90) for each batter on the team.

After calculating EV90, the script creates a graphic that represents the Top 10 (in order) with the player's headshot and EV90 figure.
